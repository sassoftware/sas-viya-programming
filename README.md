# SAS Viya Programming Examples
## Overview
A collection of repositories contain code samples and other materials to help you learn to access SAS Viya services by writing programs in Python, SAS, and other languages.

* [/chicago](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/chicago) repository contains files files with data and SAS programs that are used with the *Getting Started with SAS Viya Data Mining and Machine Learning* documentation that is available from SAS.
* [/communities](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/communities) contains examples of the SAS Viya Python client written about on [SAS Communities](https://communities.sas.com/).
* [/data](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/data) contains data sets for examples.
* [/deeplearning](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/deeplearning) contains a collection of deep learning projects and accompanying files.
* [/developerTrial](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/developerTrial) contains files used to seed the experience for the SAS Viya(TM) Developer Trial. 
* [/high-frequency-analytics](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/high-frequency-analytics) contains files to show Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) to identify Turbofan Engine Asset Degradation.
* [/python](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/python) contains a collection of files for Python and Viya programming.
* [/r/data-mining](https://github.com/sabisw/sas-viya-programming/tree/patch-1/r/data-mining) contains files for Data Mining in R.
